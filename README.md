# Hi Tech Friends🪐

## 👋 About Me

I work as a **Strategic Program and Operations Manager** in the consulting world, where I thrive on solving complex problems and driving impact across organizations.

I'm passionate about learning and constantly strive to become smarter and better every day 🤘

🐶 I have a dog I absolutely love, his name is Danzig (Who Knows What Means? 🕵️)

🌍 I'm Brazilian and lived in Argentina, Turkey, and Russia, which gave me a deep appreciation for different cultures and perspectives.

🗣 I speak **Portuguese**, **English**, and **Russian**.

💻 Currently, I'm studying technology (because in today's world, it's as essential as water)!!
